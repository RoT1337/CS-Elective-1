    "\n",
    "### For Beginners\n",
    "1. Create a new Code Cell below the code snippets inside Raw Cells (Insert Cell below then convert the cell type to Code Cell). \n",
    "2. Go to your newly-created Code Cell and re-type what you see in the code snippet (don't copy-paste) \n",
    "3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell. \n",
    "4. Remember to learn by doing (not just by reading or seeing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Coders\n",
    "1. If you are not yet familiar with the concept, follow Steps 1&2 of the Instructions for Beginners\n",
    "2. If you are already familiar with the concept being presented, convert the Raw Cell into a Code Cell.\n",
    "3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell. \n",
    "4. Learn the \"adjacent concepts\", e.g. read related documentation.\n",
    "5. Help your classmates, because teaching is a wonderful way to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For All\n",
    "* Make this your personal notebook.\n",
    "    * Add your own text annotations in Markup Cells. \n",
    "    * Add comments to parts of code that you find difficult to understand\n",
    "    * Breakdown difficult code into several small pieces (maybe, several Code Cells) that are easier to understand\n",

If you are working on a million-line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. We need ways to **break large programs into multiple smaller pieces** so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature.\n",
